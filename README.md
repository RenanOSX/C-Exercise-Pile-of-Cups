# Pile of Cups
This is a simple project from my Puc Campinas using the C language.

The challenge was to create a pile of cups using concepts like: Linked Lists, Piles and FIFO. Those concepts and other ones were used in this simple project to get a better understanding of how to handle data, use structures, better utilizing pointers, dynamic linked lists and much more.

Rules of the task:
- Use concepts like (Linked Lists, Piles, FIFO etc..).
- Ask the user the number of cups to make a pile.
- The pile has to be mostly symmetrical (More cups on the bottom than the top part, so the pile can still be "up").
- Each cup need to have a specific character assigned to it, limited to 26 characters (On my project is possible to go above it if necessary).
- Use dynamic Lists on its base.
